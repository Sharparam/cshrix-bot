Contributing Please see the CONTRIBUTING document for our contribution guidelines. End-to-end (E2E) encryption In order for E2EE features to work, libolm must be available on the system PATH or located alongside the executable (cshrix calls into it using P/Interop). Linux Check if your distro's package manager has libolm available. It usually goes under the name libolm and/or libolm-dev . Debian/Ubuntu Debian: buster/sid and later. Ubuntu: 18.04 (bionic) and later. # apt install libolm-dev Arch libolm is available in the AUR and as a git version . Windows As of right now (2019-04-23), no official Windows releases of libolm exist. Build the library manually and place it either somewhere on the PATH or alongside the executable. macOS Unknown. If someone has information about libolm on macOS, please make a PR and update this section."

There are different issue templates defined depending on what you are reporting. We kindly ask that you do not \"fire and forget\" issues. If you report an issue then please remember to come back and respond to any questions or feedback given by us! Code style This project defines a code style compatible with both ReSharper and Rider, please make use of them if you are in a supported environment. The project also has an EditorConfig file supplied, defining some basic formatting rules. Below follow some basic style guidelines but they may not be exhaustive due to the immense number of rules defined in the settings. For a definitive list of what style rules are required, consult the EditorConfig and solution settings files. File header Each file should begin with the following header text: Copyright (c) 2019 by Adam Hellberg. This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/. Additionally, for C# source code files, wrap the notice inside a copyright tag: // <copyright file=\"MyFile.cs\"> // Copyright (c) 2019 by Adam Hellberg. // // This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public // License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this // file, You can obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/. // </copyright> The ReSharper/Rider settings include a file template which inserts this text automatically in new files created by them. Indentation Indentation is done only with space, unless tabs are required by the file format. The number of spaces to indent with is by default 4, but can be different in certain file types, as shown below. Indentation of C# source files is done with 4 spaces. Indentation of XML files (including CSPROJ files) is done with 2 spaces. Indentation of YAML and JSON files is done with 2 spaces. For other files, consult the EditorConfig files. EOL whitespace All end-of-line (EOL) whitespace is to be stripped from all files. If a file format explicitly requires EOL whitespace for some functionality, exceptions can be made and will be listed in the EditorConfig file. Naming rules Private non-readonly fields: _lowerCamelCase Parameters: lowerCamelCase Local variables: lowerCamelCase Interfaces: IUpperCamelCase Type parameters: TUpperCamelCase Everything else: UpperCamelCase (AKA PascalCase ) The above naming rules are defined in the ReSharper/Rider settings. In addition, async methods must be namd with an Async suffix. For example: async Task DoSomethingAsync() . Names of type parameters should either be a singular T , or a T followed by a PascalCased name, like TError . Braces Brace layout is to put braces on the next line for all constructs that use braces, for example: namespace Test { public class Foo { } } For short inline stuff like arrays, braces on one line can be accepted, for example: var mySimpleArray = new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }; File layout Follow the same file layout as mandated by StyleCop ( SA1201 and SA1203 ). Using statements using statements are placed as deep as possible, usually this means placing them just inside the namespace definition. They should also be alphabetically ordered and grouped based on the top-level name, with the exception that the System namespace is always the first group. Fully qualified using statements are not required when they can be shortened. For example: namespace Test { using System; using System.Net; using Cshrix; using Newtonsoft.Json; public class Foo { } } Miscellaneous Use var where possible."
